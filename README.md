# Newton Salesforce app

This a Salesforce DX project to demo how to make Http requests using the [Newton Api](https://github.com/aunyks/newton-api)

## How login to the application

 Login to the following [org](https://customer-connect-469-dev-ed.lightning.force.com/lightning/page/home).
 I created a new user account, and the invite should be waiting for your engineering email account.
 That is the only way I know to get around the MFA challenge, but if you don't see an invite to my org, please let me know.

 From the home tab, you should see the lwc component itself. I hope it's use is self-explanatory :)
